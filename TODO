1. git bisect: Make it clear bisect, explain that normally is used to detect some not desired bug, and goes like good bad untill find the exact commit that introduces a bad behaviour
2. revert: Revert will revert an spefici commit, not the entire story, would be something like A -- B -- C -- D -- E -- F (undo B)
